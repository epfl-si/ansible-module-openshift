`epfl_si.ansible_module_openshift`
=========

This role provides the `openshift` module, that you can use to create
an `openshift` task:

```yaml
- name: "My ImageStream"
  openshift:
    state: latest
    kind: ImageStream
    metadata:
      name: "{{ image_name }}"
      namespace: "{{ openshift_namespace }}
      labels:
        app: MyApp
```

This ensures that the Kubernetes object of the provided `name` and
`namespace` exists and (under `state: latest`) that the desired state
(in the Ansible YAML structure) is a strict subset of the in-cluster
state (as retrieved with `oc get -o yaml`). If that is not the case,
the role applies the desired mutations (using `oc apply` if the object
already exists, and `oc create` otherwise).

Requirements
------------

- A working `oc` or `kubectl` command
- Suitable access to the cluster (i.e. you must be logged in prior to
  running atask that uses this module)

Example Playbook
----------------


```yaml
    - hosts: all
      roles:
         # Loads library/openshift.py to make it available to other plays;
         # does nothing else by itself
         - { role: epfl_si.openshift_module }
   - hosts: all
     tasks:
     - name: "My ImageStream"
       openshift:
         state: latest
         kind: ImageStream
         metadata:
           name: "{{ image_name }}"
           namespace: "{{ openshift_namespace }}"
           labels:
             app: MyApp
```
